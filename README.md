* **Interactive Physics:** Realistic beam rotation and pan leveling logic based on weight differences.
* **Audio Feedback:** Integrated sound effects for adding (`plusclick.mp3`) and removing (`minclick.mp3`) weights.
* **Fully Responsive:** Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices using CSS Flexbox and Grid.
* **Educational Tool:** Perfect for demonstrating basic physics and math concepts like equilibrium and mass.

## 🛠️ Built With
